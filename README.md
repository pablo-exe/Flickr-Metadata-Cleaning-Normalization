# Flickr-Metadata-Cleaning-Normalization
Built a robust data cleaning pipeline for a large Flickr book-metadata dataset: profiled memory usage, removed low-value columns (high nulls/repeats), standardized publication dates via regex extraction, and normalized place-of-publication values to consistent labels, reducing dataset size and improving data quality for downstream analysis.
